Citibike Data

I have downloaded data from this year (2020) because I want to see the change
in business brought on by the COVID 19 lockdowns. The data ranges from Jan to
Sep 2020 and details locations, time, birth year of users etc...

files are way too big to load all directly so will sample the data with python

samples (stack overflow).

used a union to join the data
manually cleaned erroneous columns in data after dt split

per Citibike: This data has been processed to remove trips that are taken by
staff as they service and inspect the system, trips that are taken to/from any
of our “test” stations (which we were using more in June and July 2013), and
any trips that were below 60 seconds in length (potentially false starts or
users trying to re-dock a bike to ensure it's secure).
